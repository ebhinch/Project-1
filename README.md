Project #1: Let the Games Begin

For your first project you will build a simple game as a Web Application. You may choose from one of the ideas listed below or you may choose another game with approval from one of the WDI instructors.

BLACKJACK:
- Write a BlackJack game to try to beat the dealer. Allow the user to "Hit" or "Stand" based on their current score. Follow the common rules for BlackJack.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The objectives of this project are to:
- Demonstrate your ability to use HTML and CSS to build and style an intuitive web application
- Demonstrate your competancy in DOM manipulation using JavaScript
- Publish your source code to GitHub with a solid README.md describing the project
- Deploy your application to a production environment such as GitHub Pages or BitBalloon
- Present your project in a presentation style format

BONUS IDEAS:

- Allow the user to place a bet (using chips, points, or dollars). Allocate a starting amount of chips and keep track of the user's chip count. If the user beats the dealer without busting, the user doubles their bet in chips. Otherwise the user loses their bet.
- Allow the user to choose from different decks of cards (e.g. different styles)
