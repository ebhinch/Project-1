Project #1: Let the Games Begin


Write a BlackJack game to try to beat the dealer. Allow the user to "Hit" or "Stand" based on their current score. Follow the common rules for BlackJack.

Bonus Ideas:

Allow the user to place a bet (using chips, points, or dollars). Allocate a starting amount of chips and keep track of the user's chip count. If the user beats the dealer without busting, the user doubles their bet in chips. Otherwise the user loses their bet.
Allow the user to choose from different decks of cards (e.g. different styles)
